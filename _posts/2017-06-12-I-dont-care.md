I don't care about a lot of things. Here me out. If you happen to be one of the billions, and chances are you are, that follow some sort of news source; the world is in chaos. That's not the point of this post, well sort of.

Part of what I think keeps me sane is simply not caring about all the drama in the world. Everyone is fighting over their beliefs and it doesn't seem to get anywhere. Fighting with words and law instead of guns and swords. Just for the life of me, I can't mentially follow or bother engaging in the conversation to care. I might share a comment or question here or there to try to make sense of it but at the end of the day, unless it impacts me, I don't really care. 

Some might chalk that up to "white privilage" and maybe it is but even that doesn't mean anything to me. I'm just another white dude trying to figure out life and somehow make a living that supports it. I face the same challenges. I'm left trying to find a job that I'm qualified to do, which tbh I don't feel like is much, and somehow muster some enjoyment for the job.

I'm not a people person, never have been. I like to keep a small group of trusted individuals in my circle and not care about the rest. I'm introverted, I like to be left alone most of the time to do whatever it is I feel like doing. Getting paid for a job would be a added perk. When I feel like being social, I'll move to where people tend to hang out.

When I'm out in public, I tend to simply not care about what those around me are doing or saying. To care will simply feed on my anxiety and just make my experience of being in public worse and push me back into hiding. Mentally, I can't afford to care. Those with negative comments can go eff themselves. I don't make an effort to talk to people unless I have to for like locating things in a store and whatnot.

The annoying part is from not caring or talking to people, that ends up effecting my depression. Like a mental tugawar. I have found that life is all about finding that ballance. I like being around people I trust, not so much for the general public.

And with that, cheers.
