Hello. Technically this is the second post but whatever. My name is Michael, you may have seen my tech blog called "The Lone Geek". I talk about tech related stuff when I get around to it. This blog can be takened as a viewpoint of one with aspergers. I'm going to try to write about my self, I'm not too great at it actually. There's something about just spewing personal details for the world to see that kinda makes me uncomfortable.

Well, here it goes. I have aspergers in case you haven't guessed. It's not offically dianosed but I'm pretty positive I do. I meet all the tendacies. I don't consider myself normal by societies standards but I'm also not "mentally retarded". (Side note: I don't conform to the politically correct thing so if that bothers you, you can hit the home button in your browser. I'm not completely insensitive but I won't stop using a word because it might bother someone when it's appropreate for the topic at hand. I also don't use racial slurs because I don't see the point and that's kinda mean.)

Anyway, due to my aspergers, I tend to be of the quiet type. Always have, I barely speak in public. Usually just short phrases or words here and there, I don't engage in long conversations unless it's with someone I know and trust. I'm very selective in who I trust, which could be part of the reason why this blog stayed empty for like a year from when I bought the domain. The more trust I have with someone, the more I feel comfortable opening up to someone. Growing up, I was the shy kid. Still am.

People joke or quip about me being quiet. Some will say, "You sure talk a lot." or "you just can't get them (my sisters and I) to stop talking" as some sort of way to get us to speak up or something. Yeah, my sisters are in the same boat. I don't know if they have aspergers too but they generally don't talk unless spoken to or feel they have something relateable. I'm the same way. It could be an aspie thing, I'm not sure.

Ok. That's it for the intro. I may blog again another time so cheers!
